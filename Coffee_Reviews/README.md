**ARABICA AND ROBUSTA COFFEE RATINGS: Information Visualisation: VEGALITE**

**TECHNOLOGY USED:** Vegalite

**AIM:** Three distinct visualisations illustrating some complex aspect of the Coffees.

**DATASET:** Arabica and Robusta Coffee Ratings

The Arabica Coffee Ratings and the Robusta Coffee Ratings datasets consists of the reviews from specialized reviewers for both coffees: Arabica and Robusta. 

*For each dataset, various Quality Measures are given such as:*
	
  1. Aroma: A distinctive, typically pleasant smell.
  2. Flavor: The distinctive taste of Coffee.
  3. Aftertaste: Remaining taste in the mouth after drinking Coffee.
  4. Acidity: Range of flavors perceived in coffee, attributed to acids in coffee beans.
  5. Body: The physical properties of the coffee, mouthfeel: Oily, Greasy,Watery
  6. Balance
  7. Uniformity:The consistency in coffee beans.
  8. Cup Cleanliness
  9. Sweetness: A mild,smooth coffee flavor taste sensation without any harsh tastes.
  10. Moisture: The moisture content in coffee beans.
  11. Defects and so on.

*Also the meta data related to the Bean comprises of:*
	
  1. Processing Method: The method used to produce Coffee.
  2. Color: The color of the coffee bean.
  3. Species: Different types of Coffee. (Arabica / Robusta).


*At last the location details where the coffee beans are grown such as:*
	
  1. Owner:One who owns the farms for the Coffee farming.
  2. Country of Origin: Country where the coffee production takes place.
  3. Farm Name: Actual farm where coffee grows.
  4. Lot Number: It signifies the batch Number.
  5. Mill: The storage Mill where the coffee is stored.
  6. Company: Manufacturing company of Coffee.
  7. Altitude: Heights at which Coffee farming is done.
  8. Region: The specific region of country that grows Coffee.

**INITIAL QUESTIONS:**

*Visualisation 1:*

1. After roasting, just about all coffees look the same but there are a number of parameters they vary on. Which all countries are the major producers of average number of coffee bags for both the species of Coffee?

2. What is the distribution for Robusta and Arabica species of coffee?


*Visualisation 2:*

1. Arabica and Robusta. These are the two fundamental coffee varieties that are grown for drinking. From the previous visualization, Arabica Coffee is believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is the dominant cultivar, representing more than half of global production. It is apt to analyse now: How the Arabica and Robusta Coffee varies over the period of years ranging from 2009 till 2018 over multiple quality measures.

2. How the mean and median of such quality measures varies over the years for both the Coffee Species?

3. Are the species consistent on their quality or are they improving or deteriorating over the time span of 10 years? 

*Visualisation 3:*

The height and climate of the farm can impact the type of coffee a farmer may choose to plant. Farmers thus selects their coffee plant variety according to their climate, elevation they are at. It is apt to analyse now: 
1. How the coffee growth in any country varies over the altitude ?

2. Which country is capable of supporting coffee growth at maximum altitudes ?

3. Which is the mean altitude (in meters)optimum for mass coffee production ? 

4. How much amount of coffee (in kgs) can be grown at various altitude levels and how their growth varies in the top five coffee growing countries?

5. What is the mean altitude for countires to grow Coffee in bulk amount ?
